# p5_gameOfLife

## A Game of Life made in p5.js
### What ?
This is a project with different Game of Life implementations in Processing/Javascript p5.js, developped to train on Processing, Javascript ES2015 (especially POO in js), 2D/3D general coding... and to have fun :grimacing: :star2: 

### Where ?
Just test it here !

### TODO :
* mouse drawing
* add other parameters to the navbar (inter-state or not, color themes...)
* pixel mode instead of bufferImage for big sizes


### LATER :
* improve responsive and control on phone screen
* Try to implement 3D mode
